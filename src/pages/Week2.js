            <p>Throughout the time of the second week we talked about what we wanted to learn from this course and how we wanted to achieve it.
                Another thing we did was attempting to introduce ourselves both formally and informally, it also included chatting about our field of study.
                 We also were given a task to make a summary of an article / text about what you need in order to be a good write (or anyone you want to be).
