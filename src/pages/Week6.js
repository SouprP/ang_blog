            <h1>Week 6</h1>
            <p>
                During the 6th week we talked a lot about <u>identies, stereotypes, prejudies</u> and how people 
                see us based on our apperance, accent and descent. This topic was actually engrossing for me as I myself sometimes encounter 
                misleading identity assumptions because of my russian accent and overall more eastern european looks even though I'm one hundred percent polish.

                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                But overall by the end of week 6 I felt like not only <u>learning some new vocabulary, but also having 
                some deeper thoughts abour morality and judgements.</u>
